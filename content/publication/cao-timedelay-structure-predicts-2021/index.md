abstract: "Background The detection of intrinsic brain activity (iBA) could
  assist clinical assessment for disorder of consciousness (DOC) patients.
  Previous studies have revealed the altered iBA in thalamocortical,
  frontoparietal, and default mode network in DOC patients using functional
  connectivity (FC) analysis. However, due to the assumption of synchronized iBA
  in FC, these studied may be inadequate for understanding the effect of severe
  brain injury on the temporal organization of iBA and the relationship between
  temporal organization and clinical feature in DOC patients. Recently, the time
  delay estimation (TDE) and probabilistic flow estimation (PFE) were proposed
  to analyze temporal organization, which could provide propagation structure
  and propagation probability at whole-brain level. Methods We applied
  voxel-wise TDE and PFE to assess propagation structure and propagation
  probability for the DOC patients and then applied the connectome-based
  predictive modeling (CPM) to predict clinical scores for patients based on the
  ROI-wise TDE and PFE. Results We found that: 1) the DOC patients showed
  abnormal voxel-wise time delay (TD) and probabilistic flow (PF) in the
  precentral gyrus, precuneus, middle cingulate cortex, and postcentral gyrus,
  2) the range of TD value in the patients was shorter than that in the
  controls, and 3) the ROI-wise TD had a better predictive performance for
  clinical scores of the patients compared with that based on ROI-wise PF.
  Conclusion Our findings may suggest that the propagation structure of iBA
  could be used to predict clinical scores in DOC patients."
