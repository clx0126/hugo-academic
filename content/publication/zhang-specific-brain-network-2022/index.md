abstract: Individuals use social information to guide social interactions and to
  update relationships along multiple social dimensions. However, it is unclear
  what neural basis underlies this process of abstract ``social navigation''. In
  the current study, we recruited twenty-nine participants who performed a
  choose-your-own-adventure game in which they interacted with fictional
  characters during fMRI scanning. Using a whole-brain GLM approach, we found
  that vectors encoding two-dimensional information about the relationships
  predicted BOLD responses in the hippocampus and the precuneus, replicating
  previous work. We also explored whether these geometric representations were
  related to key brain regions previously identified in physical and abstract
  spatial navigation studies, but we did not find involvement of the entorhinal
  cortex, parahippocampal gyrus or the retrosplenial cortex. Finally, we used
  psychophysiological interaction analysis and identified a network of regions
  that correlated during participants' decisions, including the left posterior
  hippocampus, precuneus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and the
  insula. Our findings suggest a brain network for social navigation in multiple
  abstract, social dimensions that includes the hippocampus, precuneus, dlPFC,
  and insula.
