abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is
  widely used to research abnormal functional connectivity (FC) in patients with
  disorders of consciousness (DOC). However, most studies assumed steady
  spatial-temporal signal interactions between distinct brain regions during the
  scan period. The aim of this study was to explore abnormal dynamic functional
  connectivity (dFC) in DOC patients. After excluding 26 patients' data that
  failed to meet the requirements of imaging quality, we retained 19 DOC
  patients (12 with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and 7 in a minimally
  conscious state, diagnosed with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised [CRS-R]) for
  the dFC analysis. We used the sliding windows approach to construct dFC
  matrices. Then these matrices were clustered into distinct states using the
  k-means clustering algorithm. We found that the DOC patients showed decreased
  dFC in the sensory and somatomotor networks compared with the healthy
  controls. There were also significant differences in temporal properties, the
  mean dwell time (MDT) and the number of transitions (NT), between the DOC
  patients and the healthy controls. In addition, we also used a hidden Markov
  model (HMM) to test the robustness of the results. With the connectome-based
  predictive modeling (CPM) approach, we found that the properties of abnormal
  dynamic network can be used to predict the CRS-R scores of the patients after
  severe brain injury. These findings may contribute to a better understanding
  of the abnormal brain networks in DOC patients.
