abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are common
  severe affective diseases. Although previous neuroimaging studies have
  investigated brain abnormalities in MDD or BD, the structural and functional
  differences between these two disorders remain unclear. In this study, we
  adopted a multimodal approach, combining voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and
  functional connectivity (FC), to study the common and distinct structural and
  functional alterations in unmedicated MDD and BD patients. The VBM analysis
  revealed that both the MDD and BD patients showed decreased gray matter volume
  (GMV) in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC_L) and right hippocampus
  (HIP_R) compared with the healthy controls, and the MDD patients showed
  decreased GMV in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG_L) and ACC_L compared
  with the BD patients. Furthermore, we took these clusters as seed regions to
  analyze the abnormal resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in the
  patients. We found that both the MDD and BD groups had decreased RSFC between
  the ACC_L and the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC_L) and that the MDD group had
  decreased RSFC between the SFG_L and the HIP_L, compared with the healthy
  controls. Our results revealed that the MDD and BD patients were more similar
  than different in GMV and RSFC. These findings indicate that investigating the
  frontal-limbic system could be useful for understanding the underlying
  mechanisms of these two disorders.
