abstract: Brain white matter (WM) could be generally categorized into two types,
  deep and superficial WM. Studies combining these two types WM are important
  for a better understanding of brain plasticity induced by motor training. In
  this study, we applied both univariate and multivariate approaches to study
  gymnastic training-induced plasticity in brain WM. Specifically, we acquired
  diffusion tensor imaging data from 13 world class gymnasts and 14 non-athlete
  normal controls, reconstructed brain deep and superficial WM tracts, estimated
  and compared their fractional anisotropy (FA) difference between the two
  groups. Taking FA values as the features, we applied logistic regression and
  support vector machine to distinguish the gymnasts from the controls. Compared
  to the controls, the gymnasts showed lower FA in four regional deep WM tracts,
  including the occipital lobe portion of left inferior fronto-occipital
  fasciculus (IFOF.L), occipital and temporal lobe portion of right inferior
  longitudinal fasciculus (ILF.R), insular cortex portion of right uncinate
  fasciculus (UF.R), and parietal lobe portion of right arcuate fasciculus
  (AF.R). Meanwhile, we found lower FA in the superficial U-shaped tracts within
  the frontal lobe in the gymnasts compared to the controls. In addition, we
  detected that mean FA in either the AF.R or the U-shaped tracts connecting the
  left pars triangularis and superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated
  with years of training in the gymnasts. Classification analyses indicated FA
  in deep WM hold higher potential to distinguish the gymnasts from the
  controls. Overall, our findings provide a more complete picture of
  training-induced plasticity in brain WM.
