abstract: BackgroundBipolar disorder (BD) has been associated with altered brain
  structural and functional connectivity. However, little is known regarding
  alterations of the structural brain connectome in BD. The present study aimed
  to use diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and graph theory approaches to
  investigate the rich club organization and white matter structural connectome
  in BD.MethodsForty-two patients with unmedicated BD depression and 59 age-,
  sex- and handedness-matched healthy control participants underwent DTI. The
  whole-brain structural connectome was constructed by a deterministic fiber
  tracking approach. Graph theory analysis was used to examine the
  group-specific global and nodal topological properties, and rich club
  organizations, and then nonparametric permutation tests were used for group
  comparisons of network parameters.ResultsCompared with healthy control
  participants, the patients with BD showed abnormal global properties,
  including increased characteristic path length, and decreased global
  efficiency and local efficiency. Locally, the patients with BD showed abnormal
  nodal parameters (nodal strength, nodal efficiency, and nodal betweenness)
  predominantly in the parietal, orbitofrontal, occipital, and cerebellar
  regions. Moreover, the patients with BD showed decreased rich club and feeder
  connectivity density.ConclusionsOur results may reflect the disrupted white
  matter topological organization in the whole-brain, and abnormal regional
  connectivity supporting cognitive and affective functioning in depressed BD,
  which, in part, be due to impaired rich club connectivity.
