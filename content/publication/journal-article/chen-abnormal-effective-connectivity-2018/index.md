abstract: A number of studies have indicated that disorders of consciousness
  result from multifocal injuries as well as from the impaired functional and
  anatomical connectivity between various anterior forebrain regions. However,
  the specific causal mechanism linking these regions remains unclear. In this
  study, we used spectral dynamic causal modeling to assess how the effective
  connections (ECs) between various regions differ between individuals. Next, we
  used connectome-based predictive modeling to evaluate the performance of the
  ECs in predicting the clinical scores of DOC patients. We found increased ECs
  from the striatum to the globus pallidus as well as from the globus pallidus
  to the posterior cingulate cortex, and decreased ECs from the globus pallidus
  to the thalamus and from the medial prefrontal cortex to the striatum in DOC
  patients as compared to healthy controls. Prediction of the patients' outcome
  was effective using the negative ECs as features. In summary, the present
  study highlights a key role of the thalamo-basal ganglia-cortical loop in DOCs
  and supports the anterior forebrain mesocircuit hypothesis. Furthermore, EC
  could be potentially used to assess the consciousness level.
