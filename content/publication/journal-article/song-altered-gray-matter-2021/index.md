abstract: Cognitive and emotional impairments observed in mild traumatic brain
  injury (mTBI) patients may reflect variances of brain connectivity within
  specific networks. Although previous studies found altered functional
  connectivity (FC) in mTBI patients, the alterations of brain structural
  properties remain unclear. In the present study, we analyzed structural
  covariance (SC) for the acute stages of mTBI (amTBI) patients, the chronic
  stages of mTBI (cmTBI) patients, and healthy controls. We first extracted the
  mean gray matter volume (GMV) of seed regions that are located in the
  default-mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), salience network
  (SN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and the visual network (VN). Then we
  determined and compared the SC for each seed region among the amTBI, the cmTBI
  and the healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, the amTBI patients
  showed lower SC for the ECN, and the cmTBI patients showed higher SC for the
  both DMN and SN but lower SC for the SMN. The results revealed disrupted ECN
  in the amTBI patients and disrupted DMN, SN and SMN in the cmTBI patients.
  These alterations suggest that early disruptions in SC between bilateral
  insula and the bilateral prefrontal cortices may appear in amTBI and persist
  into cmTBI, which might be potentially related to the cognitive and emotional
  impairments.
