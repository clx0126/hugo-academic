 abstract = {Cognitive and emotional impairments observed in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients may reflect variances of brain connectivity within specific networks. Although previous studies found altered functional connectivity (FC) in mTBI patients, the alterations of brain structural properties remain unclear. In the present study, we analyzed structural covariance (SC) for the acute stages of mTBI (amTBI) patients, the chronic stages of mTBI (cmTBI) patients, and healthy controls. We first extracted the mean gray matter volume (GMV) of seed regions that are located in the default-mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and the visual network (VN). Then we determined and compared the SC for each seed region among the amTBI, the cmTBI and the healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, the amTBI patients showed lower SC for the ECN, and the cmTBI patients showed higher SC for the both DMN and SN but lower SC for the SMN. The results revealed disrupted ECN in the amTBI patients and disrupted DMN, SN and SMN in the cmTBI patients. These alterations suggest that early disruptions in SC between bilateral insula and the bilateral prefrontal cortices may appear in amTBI and persist into cmTBI, which might be potentially related to the cognitive and emotional impairments.},
