abstract: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by emotion dysregulation and
  involves changes in the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). Although
  previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies reported changes in the
  diffusion properties of the deep WM (DWM) in BD patients, the diffusion
  properties of the superficial WM (SWM) are rarely investigated. In this study,
  we tried to determine whether the diffusion parameters of the SWM were altered
  in BD patients compared to controls and whether the changes were associated
  with the disrupted emotion regulation of the BD patients. We collected DTI
  data from 37 BD patients and 42 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HC).
  Using probabilistic tractography, we defined a population-based SWM mask based
  on all the subjects. After performing the tract-based spatial statistical
  (TBSS) analyses, we identified the SWM areas in which the BD patients differed
  from the controls. This study showed significantly reduced fractional
  anisotropy in the SWM (FASWM) in the BD patients compared to the HC in the
  bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal
  cortex (vlPFC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the left parietal cortex.
  Moreover, compared to the controls, the BD patients showed significantly
  increased mean diffusivity (MDSWM) and radial diffusivity (RDSWM) in the SWM
  in the right frontal cortex. This study presents altered cortico-cortical
  connections proximal to the regions related to the emotion dysregulation of BD
  patients, which indicated that the SWM may serve as the brain's structural
  basis underlying the disrupted emotion regulation of BD patients. The
  disrupted FASWM in the parietal cortex may indicate that the emotion
  dysregulation in BD patients is related to the cognitive control network.
