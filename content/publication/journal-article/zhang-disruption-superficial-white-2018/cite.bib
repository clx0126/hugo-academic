 abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by emotion dysregulation and involves changes in the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). Although previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies reported changes in the diffusion properties of the deep WM (DWM) in BD patients, the diffusion properties of the superficial WM (SWM) are rarely investigated. In this study, we tried to determine whether the diffusion parameters of the SWM were altered in BD patients compared to controls and whether the changes were associated with the disrupted emotion regulation of the BD patients. We collected DTI data from 37 BD patients and 42 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Using probabilistic tractography, we defined a population-based SWM mask based on all the subjects. After performing the tract-based spatial statistical (TBSS) analyses, we identified the SWM areas in which the BD patients differed from the controls. This study showed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy in the SWM (FASWM) in the BD patients compared to the HC in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the left parietal cortex. Moreover, compared to the controls, the BD patients showed significantly increased mean diffusivity (MDSWM) and radial diffusivity (RDSWM) in the SWM in the right frontal cortex. This study presents altered cortico-cortical connections proximal to the regions related to the emotion dysregulation of BD patients, which indicated that the SWM may serve as the brain's structural basis underlying the disrupted emotion regulation of BD patients. The disrupted FASWM in the parietal cortex may indicate that the emotion dysregulation in BD patients is related to the cognitive control network.},
