 abstract = {During naturalistic vision, the brain generates coherent percepts by integrating sensory inputs scattered across the visual field. Here, we asked whether this integration process is mediated by rhythmic cortical feedback. In electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we experimentally manipulated integrative processing by changing the spatiotemporal coherence of naturalistic videos presented across visual hemifields. Our EEG data revealed that information about incoherent videos is coded in feedforward-related gamma activity while information about coherent videos is coded in feedback-related alpha activity, indicating that integration is indeed mediated by rhythmic activity. Our fMRI data identified scene-selective cortex and human middle temporal complex (hMT) as likely sources of this feedback. Analytically combining our EEG and fMRI data further revealed that feedback-related representations in the alpha band shape the earliest stages of visual processing in cortex. Together, our findings indicate that the construction of coherent visual experiences relies on cortical feedback rhythms that fully traverse the visual hierarchy.},
