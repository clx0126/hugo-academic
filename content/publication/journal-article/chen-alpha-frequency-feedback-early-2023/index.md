abstract: During naturalistic vision, the brain generates coherent percepts by integrating
  sensory inputs scattered across the visual field. Here, we asked whether this integration
  process is mediated by rhythmic cortical feedback. In electroencephalography (EEG)
  and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we experimentally
  manipulated integrative processing by changing the spatiotemporal coherence of naturalistic
  videos presented across visual hemifields. Our EEG data revealed that information
  about incoherent videos is coded in feedforward-related gamma activity while information
  about coherent videos is coded in feedback-related alpha activity, indicating that
  integration is indeed mediated by rhythmic activity. Our fMRI data identified scene-selective
  cortex and human middle temporal complex (hMT) as likely sources of this feedback.
  Analytically combining our EEG and fMRI data further revealed that feedback-related
  representations in the alpha band shape the earliest stages of visual processing
  in cortex. Together, our findings indicate that the construction of coherent visual
  experiences relies on cortical feedback rhythms that fully traverse the visual hierarchy.
