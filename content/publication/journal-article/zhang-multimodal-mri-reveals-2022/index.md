abstract: "Background Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disorder with severe
  implications for those affected and their families. Previous studies detected
  brain structural and functional alterations in BD patients. However, very few
  studies conducted a multimodal MRI fusion analysis, and little is known about
  the role of common anomalies in the connectivity of BD. Methods We collected
  sMRI, rs-fMRI, and DTI data from 56 patients with unmedicated BD-II depression
  and 72 age-, sex- and handedness-matched healthy controls. We applied
  data-driven approaches to analyze multimodal MRI data and detected brain areas
  with significant group differences in cortical thickness (CT), amplitude of
  low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the
  superficial white matter. We observed the common abnormal areas and took these
  areas as seeds to analyze the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC)
  patterns in BD patients by overlapping these abnormal areas. Results The BD
  patients showed two common abnormal areas: (1) the left anterior insula (AI)
  with abnormal CT and FA, and (2) the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
  with abnormal CT and ALFF. Seed-based analyses showed RSFC between the left AI
  and left occipital sensory cortex, the left AI and left superior and inferior
  parietal cortex, and the left PCC and right medial prefrontal cortex were
  uniformly lower in the BD patients than controls. Correlation analyses showed
  negative correction between AI's FA and disease episodes and between AI's FA
  and disease duration in depressed BD-II patients. Conclusions We observed
  abnormal brain structural and functional properties in the left AI and left
  PCC in BD patients. The abnormal RSFC patterns may suggest sensory and
  cognitive dysfunction in BD."
