abstract: To create coherent visual experiences, the brain spatially integrates the
  complex and dynamic information it receives from the environment. We previously
  demonstrated that feedback-related alpha activity carries stimulus-specific information
  when two spatially and temporally coherent naturalistic inputs can be integrated
  into a unified percept. In this study, we sought to determine whether such integration-related
  alpha dynamics are triggered by categorical coherence in visual inputs. In an EEG
  experiment, we manipulated the degree of coherence by presenting pairs of videos
  from the same or different categories through two apertures in the left and right
  visual hemifields. Critically, video pairs could be video-level coherent (i.e.,
  stem from the same video), coherent in their basic-level category, coherent in their
  superordinate category, or incoherent (i.e., stem from videos from two entirely
  different categories). We conducted multivariate classification analyses on rhythmic
  EEG responses to decode between the video stimuli in each condition. As the key
  result, we significantly decoded the video-level coherent and basic-level coherent
  stimuli, but not the superordinate coherent and incoherent stimuli, from cortical
  alpha rhythms. This suggests that alpha dynamics play a critical role in integrating
  information across space, and that cortical integration processes are flexible enough
  to accommodate information from different exemplars of the same basic-level category.
