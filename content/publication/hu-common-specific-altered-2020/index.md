abstract: "Freezing of gait (FOG), a disabling symptom of Parkinson's disease
  (PD), severely affects PD patients' life quality. Previous studies found
  neuropathologies in functional connectivity related to FOG, but few studies
  detected abnormal regional activities related to FOG in PD patients. In the
  present study, we analyzed the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF)
  to detect brain regions showing abnormal activity in PD patients with FOG
  (PD-with-FOG) and without FOG (PD-without-FOG). As different frequencies of
  neural oscillations in brain may reflect distinct brain functional and
  physiological properties, we conducted this study in three frequency bands,
  slow-5 (0.01– 0.027~Hz), slow-4 (0.027– 0.073~Hz), and classical frequency
  band (0.01– 0.08~Hz). We acquired rs-fMRI data from 18 PD-with-FOG patients,
  18 PD-without-FOG patients, and 17 healthy controls, then calculated
  voxel-wise ALFF across the whole brain and compared ALFF among the three
  groups in each frequency band. We found: (1) in slow-5, both PD-with-FOG and
  PD-without-FOG patients showed lower ALFF in the bilateral putamen compared to
  healthy controls, (2) in slow-4, PD-with-FOG patients showed higher ALFF in
  left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and lower ALFF in right middle frontal
  gyrus (MFG) compared to either PD-without-FOG patients or healthy controls,
  (3) in classical frequency band, PD-with-FOG patients also showed higher ALFF
  in ITG compared to either PD-without-FOG patients or healthy controls.
  Furthermore, we found that ALFF in MFG and ITG in slow-4 provided the highest
  classification accuracy (96.7%) in distinguishing PD-with-FOG from
  PD-without-FOG patients by using a stepwise multivariate pattern analysis. Our
  findings indicated frequency-specific regional spontaneous neural activity
  related to FOG, which may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of FOG."
