 abstract = {Freezing of gait (FOG), a disabling symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), severely affects PD patients' life quality. Previous studies found neuropathologies in functional connectivity related to FOG, but few studies detected abnormal regional activities related to FOG in PD patients. In the present study, we analyzed the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) to detect brain regions showing abnormal activity in PD patients with FOG (PD-with-FOG) and without FOG (PD-without-FOG). As different frequencies of neural oscillations in brain may reflect distinct brain functional and physiological properties, we conducted this study in three frequency bands, slow-5 (0.01– 0.027~Hz), slow-4 (0.027– 0.073~Hz), and classical frequency band (0.01– 0.08~Hz). We acquired rs-fMRI data from 18 PD-with-FOG patients, 18 PD-without-FOG patients, and 17 healthy controls, then calculated voxel-wise ALFF across the whole brain and compared ALFF among the three groups in each frequency band. We found: (1) in slow-5, both PD-with-FOG and PD-without-FOG patients showed lower ALFF in the bilateral putamen compared to healthy controls, (2) in slow-4, PD-with-FOG patients showed higher ALFF in left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and lower ALFF in right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) compared to either PD-without-FOG patients or healthy controls, (3) in classical frequency band, PD-with-FOG patients also showed higher ALFF in ITG compared to either PD-without-FOG patients or healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that ALFF in MFG and ITG in slow-4 provided the highest classification accuracy (96.7%) in distinguishing PD-with-FOG from PD-without-FOG patients by using a stepwise multivariate pattern analysis. Our findings indicated frequency-specific regional spontaneous neural activity related to FOG, which may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of FOG.},
