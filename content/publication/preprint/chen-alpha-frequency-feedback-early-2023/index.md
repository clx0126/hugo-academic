abstract: "For coherent visual experience to emerge, the brain needs to
  spatially integrate the complex and dynamic information it receives from the
  environment. To meet this challenge, the visual system uses contextual
  information from one part of the visual field to create feedback signals that
  guide analysis in other parts of the visual field. Here, we set out to
  characterize the nature of this feedback across brain rhythms and cortical
  regions. In EEG and fMRI experiments, we experimentally recreated the
  spatially distributed nature of visual inputs by presenting natural videos at
  different visual field locations. Critically, we manipulated the
  spatiotemporal congruency of the videos, so that they did or did not demand
  integration into a coherent percept. Decoding stimulus information from
  frequency-specific EEG patterns revealed a shift from representations in
  feedforward-related gamma activity for spatiotemporally inconsistent videos to
  representations in feedback-related alpha activity for spatiotemporally
  consistent videos. Our fMRI data suggest high-level scene-selective areas as
  the putative source of this feedback. Combining the EEG data with spatially
  resolved fMRI recordings, we demonstrate that alpha-frequency feedback is
  directly associated with representations in early visual cortex. Together this
  demonstrates how the human brain orchestrates coherent visual experience
  across space: it uses feedback to integrate information from high-level to
  early visual cortex through a dedicated rhythmic code in the alpha frequency
  range."
